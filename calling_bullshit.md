# Calling bullshit
## Or the story of how Gagarin never said what he never said.

Calling bullshit on things people assume to be facts is one of the most arduous and yet most pleasing tasks a writer — be it technical or not — can devote their attention to.

I will not even get started with the infamous “Einstein quote” about fish and climbing the tree (maybe some other time). I’ll, rather, reach the stars with a little story about commie lies. This is the story of what Yuri Gagarin, the Earth’s first cosmonaut never said.

Both the Vostok 1 mission as its pilot — a man, a hero of the Soviet Union — has been veiled in multiple mysteries, understatements and misrepresentations for years. One of those mysteries are the circumstances of his death — the investigation has been closed while the evidence has been sealed and put off. Maybe to be returned to, or maybe — to never again be returned to.

One of the common false pieces of information concerning Gagarin is the persistently missattributed quote about him not finding God in space. The situation here is similar to the one with the notoriously shared (especially on Facebook) idiotic “Einstein quote” about evaluating a fish based on its ability to climb a tree. Both here and there the sources for the missattribution are multiple but debunking this piece of fake news is rather quick and fairly easy.

Let’s recall the quote itself first:

> I looked and looked but I didn’t see God.

The hero of the Soviet Union has allegedly said this line on April 14th, 1961, after returning safely to Earth. In fact, Gagarin has never said anything like that. There are two potential sources for both the quote and its attribution to the world’s first cosmonaut.

It is only right to remind, that Yuri Gagarin was a believer, a member of the Russian Orthodox Church. Such a person would need rather serious motivation to deny God. Even though — quite honestly — Soviet Union was rather good at delivering this kind of motivation.

It seems, however, truth is different. Here is the second Soviet cosmonaut, Gherman Titov. A good comrade and a declared atheist, denying the existence of gods and rejecting the need for religion. His own words express his views best:

> I don’t believe in God. I believe in man — his strength, his possibilities, his reason.

This alone is enough to make Titov’s stand clear, but what is much more important are words that are an earlier part of the same statement, as noted by Pavel Barashev and Yuri Dokuchayev (later quoted by Christine Spillson in her “Lower orbits: remembering Gherman Titov” in 2017):

> Some say God is living there [in space]. I was looking around very attentively, but I did not see anyone there. I did not detect either angels or gods…

There is a striking resemblance between Titov’s statement and the alleged Gagarin quotation. All factors suggest the original author was the second, not the first of Soviet cosmonauts. Why would it, however, be attributed to Gagarin instead? The answer to that question is probably very prosaic. As related (confirmed, e.g. by colonel Valentin Petrov in this 2006 interview), the statement comes from a speech on state anti-religious campaign, delivered at a plenum of the Central Committee by Nikita Kruschev, the first secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. What he supposedly said, was:

> Gagarin flew into space, but didn’t see any god there.

It seems the situation is similar to the case of “the Einstein fish” mentioned on top of this piece, which was partly fabricated, partly based on previous writings and eventually invented by Mathew Kelly in his own 2004 book “The Rhythm of Life: Living Every Day with Passion and Purpose” as reported by Todd Pettigrew. There indeed was once a cosmonaut, who was no comrade to God, but the communist first secretary has mentioned the wrong spacefarer.

There is another version of the quote, a very similar one, allegedly uttered by Gagarin during the Vostok 1 flight:

> I see no God up here.

There is no evidence nor an indication of this kind of statement to be found in any official documents or transcript from the pioneer spaceflight. It looks like a post-factum fabrication or misreporting of a different, though possibly real, situation.

So, has Yuri Alexeyevich Gagarin met God in space? This we do not know. We surely know Gherman Stepanovich Titov has not met Him there, which he eagerly announced.

This is how propaganda and fake news work — this quote has been up on Wikipedia for years before someone marked it as “attributed only”. Crafting parts of truth to gain traction is a great way to start. But two half-truths can still only add up to one whole lie.

Debunking this lie is good also in another respect, as it bares again the communist way of falsifying the world. And defacing commies and their lies is always a thing any decent human should do.

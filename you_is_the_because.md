# You is the because
**Or the (somewhat disenchanted) view on what and how we write online and why it is bad.**

This story got a 12.1 Coleman-Liau readability score, which means it is appropriate for a grade 10 reader.

The **SEO score** for this text is 36% which is a rather poor result. This may, however, mean it might be a good human read instead.

What we see now is like a dim image in the mirror.

TL;DR: all writing aims at selling. Search engines do not buy our products, humans do. We should not write for search engines but for humans instead.

## The purpose of writing

In the days of images and icons, the written word has significantly lost its impact. The potential readers rush and suffer attention deficiency, hence all writing longer than a glance is often omitted. This is a hard situation for anyone writing, as this invalidates the main purpose of writing anything at all.

And the main purpose of writing is to sell. Whatever you do, this is always about selling. Not only writing, but anything is about selling. Adverts sell. TV commercials sell. Facebook posts sell. Tweets sell. This may be a product, a service, a car, or a software bundle, but also your point of view, your opinion, and your image. Even your cosplay photos on Instagram sell some idea about yourself.

This is even more so in the professional writing environment, as none of us doubts this — we are here to sell. Whether we want to encourage people to try the new fancy frapuccinate grande turtleneck soda, convince them to exchange their old 2015 Combi van model for the latest hybrid 2020 model, or want them to buy a book about the Silesian private eye — we all aim at selling. Money does not need to be involved. The users’, and readers’ attention may be a currency — their time, their likes, retweets, and their recommendations pose a value that should not be overlooked.

To gain, we need to draw their attention. But to draw the attention of the recipient, we need to reach them.

## The hegemony of SEO

In the cluttered dustbin that the internet has become over the past two and a half decades gaining the attention of the potential client is a task best described as desperate. User-generated content competes with big companies’ output in the struggle for reach. Paid content attacks the strongholds of native exposure, racing to hook up with the latest trends in the short term while trying to stand relevant in the long term.

Searchability and indexability are the 20th-century golden calf, pursued by all those who want to sell. If you cannot or do not want to afford some large (and by large I do mean mammoth sometimes) spending on delivering your content where you want it, you need to rely on the unclear, shape-shifting changes of the recent Google algorithm update that may help you drift to the very first page of the search results for insanely specific keywords. Right into the middle of the page, just below the paid results.

This is one mundane task and may seem futile at times, but if you work hard, follow all the current requirements, abide by all the rules, and keep your head over the water for long enough, then you may achieve the goal and be a relevant answer for a question once asked. This is good. I mean, what is good, is that there are, after all, some rules, that can be followed to gain exposure and recognizability. Whimsical and unstable as they may be, they are there to help the big search engines streamline their results to earn more. After all — selling is the ultimate goal, isn’t it?

There is an old saying, that good content will always eventually sell, but the “eventually” part is the problem. There are, of course, cases, when incidental produce will float to the top and hit hard. It is every marketer’s wet dream, to hit big, go viral, and gain reach undreamt of before. Some of us, content producers, and online writers, try to aim for the top, but most realize that the higher you aim, the harder you fall. And then the countless faceless minions feeding the world wide web would rather settle for a scrupulous and meticulous attempt at following the rules grasping at the fleeting hope of being relevant.

Not abiding by the rules — whatever they might be this morning — is a scary, unknown land that tends to be avoided at all costs.

## The deterioration of the substance

Written content at present struggles with two, mostly mutually exclusive notions. One is the need, the must to convey a message and grasp the readers’, and users’ attention for this short period they are willing to sacrifice between their own selling attempts. The other is the burning coercion of being accountable, searchable, indexable, and Google-oriented.

Content is produced to satisfy the digital, ephemeral taste of algorithms, to try and aim at the hardly predictable liking of AI-driven mainframes that nobody knows and nobody fully understands. Things were set in motion that could not be stopped. Recent researches show, that people do not understand how and why the content is fed to them. What are the criteria that cause the choices the machines make? These elude us. And — quite frankly — hardly anybody has neither the time nor the alacrity to ponder on that in between selling and buying, amid insane, initiated consumption of goods, ideas, and concepts aimed at self-fulfillment.

And nobody cares for the content, that was delivered to them even though so much hard work, planning, and rehearsing of researched digital approaches were employed and invested into the creation of it.

This is because the content was created to satisfy the electronic collective mind of vast computing systems, digesting the data that they can process and excreting anything that deviates from the blurry guidelines confining the usefulness and desirability of those behemoth electric constructs.

The content we produce is not aimed at humans.

## The fallacy of digital totalitarianism

Networked systems are fed our content and then spew it back at our supposedly desired recipients. We aim at selling, therefore we sacrifice everything to satisfy the fastidious databanks to reach the best possible outcome — the highest searchability, the vastest topic coverage and relevancy, and the best possible saturation of keywords that could possibly draw the attention of a potential reader. We bow to the algorithm gods, bringing them the holocaust sacrifice of slanted language, simple sentences, basic vocabulary, and succinct, concise messages.

We forgot the people in the injudicious and unadvised race to reach the people.

Search engines and algorithms do not, I repeat, do not buy our products. Humans do buy our products. This is why we are so desperately trying to reach them, isn’t it so? Yes, yes it is, indeed. Very much so, we abandon humans to reach humans.

Content-oriented as satisfying the capricious expectations of digital inlets and outlets is not suited for humans to ingest. Is not amusing for humans. It is a boring, mundane, stupifying intake of semi-irrelevant data fed in a rush during transfer between one and another information outlet. The constant flow of information, news, ads, and commercial content leaves no time for reflection and thought. And none of that mass stands out, as it is all trimmed perfectly toward the same elusive goal of meeting the expectations of search engines, that will later reveal our salespoint to the searching ones.

This is a homogenous, irrelevant, uninteresting, forgettable mush that is fed without any resistance and gotten rid of and discarded with even less of that.

## The content delivery failure

People do buy products. Humans do it because they need to. These may satisfy different needs, from basic, physical, organic ones like nutrition, through the whole needs hierarchy to the very top of prestigious, image-enforcing trivial useless gimmicks that serve no real purpose. But in the overwhelming, uncanny, and never-before-seen in the history of humankind outpour of services and goods, the humans need to decide. And decision-making is a tough game.

Humans need to feel and like the product, the service, the article, or the matter. We like to create a bond with our precious possessions, whether digital or physical they may be. The bond is created when we like something when something draws our attention and when it sticks out above the level of exquisitely uniform slurry.

Humans do not understand and accept content written for machines. It evokes no emotions. It does not make them pause. Humanity will not marvel over something that is amazingly unremarkable. Marketing your sales to the liking of algorithms will not appeal to living, feeling creatures. Will not create a bond. Coming up first on a search page that returns one million identical results for one million identically described products will not distinguish this specific one from the others. The reader, the client will not care for it as this is a negligible, forgettable, inconspicuous piece of trash data that will not convince them to take any action.

We reached the client and we failed.

## The human touch

The content we produce needs to stop the recipient. Halt them in their frantic rush through all the irrelevant data and bright, garish, gaudy feeds that form an unrecognizable mess of useless and unfulfilling sales pitches. We need to talk to them like humans talk to humans.

Why would you rather choose to chat with your family over small talk with a colleague from the office? Because they care. Because they treat you like a person, not like an insignificant, negligible, nonessential receiver.

People need to gasp in awe, need to laugh, need to be surprised. People need to think, wonder, ponder the idea, recall it, and regurgitate it. Humans want to be entertained, paid attention to, adored, and cherished. People don’t need impersonal, algorithmic data streams that only provide bare information. People want involvement. The buyers need to know it is them you are selling to.

Use human language to address humans. Do not sacrifice laughter, do not abandon the invitation to put some intellectual effort into your product, and never forget the reader is not a Google harvester.

If you reach a human being, make this significant. Don’t waste all the time and effort spent on optimizing your writing toward some vaguely incomprehensible requirements of a salespoint-driven computer system on missing the point.

Humans are not computers and they do not want content aimed at computers. Do your marketing as you would do your entertainment. After all, humans do watch movies on TV but get up and go make themselves some sandwiches immediately when commercials come up. Those previously thought-over, meticulously targeted, streamlined, and refined commercials that aim at selling a product.

And if you are entertaining, relevant, useful, and most of all, if the humans can assimilate your message then maybe, just maybe, who knows? One day you may hit a viral bullseye.

“My old man is a fishing fanatic” (“Mój stary to fanatyk wędkarstwa”) is a copypasta that couldn’t care less about Google searching algorithm, keywords, readability score, or SEO assessment. Yet you can now watch it as a short movie on Netflix. So, did it sell?
